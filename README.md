# Simple Landing Page

## About project

One of the few projects where I learned how to interact with ``HTML``, ``CSS/SASS`` and ``JavaScript``. Finally it's time to post it so as not to store it on your PC. This is a simple page with minimal JavaScript code. I don't know if it's correct to use ``Webpack`` as a _dependency_ for ``Gulp``... ðŸ˜³

## Addition

This is quite old code, which means I'm a little ashamed of it (especially ``javascript``), but it works, so everything is ok ðŸ˜Ž
